/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module manages circular, doubly-linked, lists. It provides
/*	operations to initialize a list, to add or remove an element,
/*	and to iterate over a list. Although the documentation appears
/*	to emphasize the special role of the list head, each operation
/*	can be applied to each list member.
/*
/*	Examples of applications: any sequence of objects such as queue,
/*	unordered list, or stack. Typically, an application embeds a RING
/*	structure into its own data structure, and uses the RING primitives
/*	to maintain the linkage between application-specific data objects.
/*
/*	ring_init() initializes its argument to a list of just one element.
/*
/*	ring_append() appends the named element to the named list head.
/*
/*	ring_prepend() prepends the named element to the named list head.
/*
/*	ring_succ() returns the list element that follows its argument.
/*
/*	ring_pred() returns the list element that precedes its argument.
/*
/*	ring_detach() disconnects a list element from its neighbors
/*	and closes the hole. This routine performs no implicit ring_init()
/*	on the removed element.
/*
/*	RING_FOREACH() is a macro that expands to a for (... ; ... ; ...)
/*	statement that iterates over each list element in forward order.
/*	Upon completion, the \fIelement\fR variable is set equal to
/*	\fIhead\fR. The list head itself is not treated as a list member.
