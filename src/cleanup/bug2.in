# Two bugs while updating a short Subject: header immediately before
# a still virgin "append header" pointer record.
#
# Symptom:
#
#    warning: <filename>: malformed pointer record value: <garbage>
#
# Cause:
#
#    Failure to recognize the "append header" record while updating
#    a short message header
#
# Analysis:
#
# This happened while updating a header record that was followed by
# the current "append header" record. The pointer could be the initial
# "append header" record between message header and body, or it could
# be a later version of that pointer somewhere in the heap.
#
# - Postfix considered the pointer record as any pointer record after
# a header record. Thus, it decided that some portion of the pointer
# record could be overwritten with the location of the new Subject:
# header on the heap. Later "append header" operations would then
# update old "append header" record and thus clobber part of the
# pointer to the new Subject: header value.  
#
# - While saving the "append header" pointer record value on the
# heap, Postfix did not replace the still virgin "0" append header"
# pointer record value by the actual location of the message body
# content.
