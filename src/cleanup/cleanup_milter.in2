# Update a short Subject: header that immediately precedes the "append
# header" pointer record. The new Subject: header value is stored
# at the end of the heap, followed by the saved "append header"
# pointer record value.
#
# - Postfix must not consider the "append header" pointer record as
# if it were part of the short Subject: header. Instead, the record
# must be saved to the heap, right after the new Subject: header
# value.
#
# - Postfix must update its idea of the current "append header"
# pointer record location.
#
# - While saving the "append header" pointer record value, Postfix
# must replace a "0" append header" pointer record value by the
# actual location of the message body content.
