Hashing does not slow down deliveries.

However the problem is scanning an empty deferred queue. On an idle
machine, it takes some 5 seconds to scan an empty depth=2 deferred
queue unless the blocks happen to be cached. During those 5 seconds
the queue manager will not pay attention to I/O from delivery
agents, which is bad.
