# Setup chroot jail for NeXT, NEXTSTEP3.
# Some remarks to the NEXTSTEP3 jail apply:
# syslog:
#   Logging with syslog(3) uses a sendto ("/dev/log").  For this to work in
#   the jail, ${POSTFIX_DIR}/dev/log must be a hard link to /dev/log.  This
#   fails if /usr/spool/postfix is on another filesystem, and consequently,
#   running chrooted will not be possible, unless you like to run your mail
#   system without logging (not).
#
#   For this trick to work, the following should be run at every reboot,
#   preferably from /etc/rc, after syslog has been started (and given time
#   to create /dev/log):
#       POSTFIX_DIR=/usr/spool/postfix
#       rm ${POSTFIX_DIR}/dev/log
#       ln /dev/log ${POSTFIX_DIR}/dev/log

set -e

umask 022

POSTFIX_DIR=${POSTFIX_DIR-/usr/spool/postfix}

cd ${POSTFIX_DIR}

# If this fails, running chrooted will be useless.
mkdir dev
ln /dev/log dev
